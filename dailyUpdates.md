# Daily Updates For My Progress (100 days of code)

## Day 0: 28/11/2022

**Today's Progress**: I learn about the basic things what is programming and what is python? when its developed, whom is developed etc?

## Day 1: 29/11/2022

**Today's Progress**:Today I check how cool projects we can build using python...

## Day 2: 30/11/2022

**Today's Progress**:Today I learn How to integrate others' code into our code base and that integration, we called a module in python. it's simply a '.py' file that we install using a pip command.

for ex. pip install django

## Day 3: 01/12/2022

**Today's Progress**:
programming in python and let's start with the print function, 'print()' this is a print function in python, and note that in python everything is an object, so whatever you put inside that print function parenthesis of the print function will give you the output in the console,

suppose print('hello world')
this will give the result in the console, why quotes?
because python will get to know that you want to print as it is.

## Day 4: 02/12/2022

**Today's Progress**:
Learn about comments, multiline comments, escape sequence characters,
comments: Just write the notes inside the code for future reference and it did not print by python, for implementing the code just use the # before your notes,
whatever after the # sign is considered as comments.
Multiline Comments: so this is helpful while writing the paragraphs like sentences 5 or 6 lines of code, this will look nice, for making a multiline comment put notes inside triple single or double quotes like '''your multiline notes''' or """your multiline notes"""
Escape Sequence Character: just word sounds, it helps to put some kind of special character inside a string ex., \n (new line), \t (tab), etc.
