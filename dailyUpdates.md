## Day 3: 01/12/2022

**Today's Progress**:
programming in python and let's start with the print function, 'print()' this is a print function in python, and note that in python everything is an object, so whatever you put inside that print function parenthesis of the print function will give you the output in the console,

suppose print('hello world')
this will give the result in the console, why quotes?
because python will get to know that you want to print as it is.
